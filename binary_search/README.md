## Binary_Search

This Python program implements binary search to find the position of a user-entered number in a sorted list.

## Usage

1. Run `binary_search.py` in a Python environment.
2. Enter a number to find its position in the pre-defined sorted list.
3. If found, the program displays the position; if not, it indicates the number isn't in the list.

## Sample Output
### 1
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] 

Enter the Number to find the Position: 6

The Position is: 2
### 2
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] 

Enter the Number to find the Position: 5

The Entered number is not in the list .

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n)

The space complexity of binary search is O(1)
