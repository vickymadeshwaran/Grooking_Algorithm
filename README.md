## Grooking Algorithm

Welcome to the Grooking Algorithm repository! This repository contains Python-based algorithm programs and examples.

## Algorithms Included

### Binary Search

ðŸ“š The Binary Search algorithm is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently locate a target value within a sorted array.

### Quick Sorting

ðŸ“š Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy.

### Selection Sorting

ðŸ“š Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted sublist and the unsorted sublist. 

### Breadth First Search

ðŸ“š Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the current depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

ðŸ“š Dijkstra's Algorithm is a famous algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.


## Usage

Each algorithm folder contains a Python script demonstrating the algorithm and a README file with detailed explanations and instructions on how to use the code.
